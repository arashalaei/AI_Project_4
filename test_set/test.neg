the only thing in pauline and paulette that you haven't seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
fairly successful at faking some pretty cool stunts but a complete failure at trying to create some pretty cool characters . and forget about any attempt at a plot ! 
pryor lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs . 
an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal . 
an incoherent jumble of a film that's rarely as entertaining as it could have been . 
like a soft drink that's been sitting open too long : it's too much syrup and not enough fizz . 
the people in abc africa are treated as docile , mostly wordless ethnographic extras . 
throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . 
it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . 
full of the kind of obnoxious chitchat that only self-aware neurotics engage in . 
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features . 
even the finest chef can't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro can't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . 
die another day is only intermittently entertaining but it's hard not to be a sucker for its charms , or perhaps it's just impossible not to feel nostalgia for movies you grew up with . 
nothing about this movie works . 
final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . 
'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances . 
written , flatly , by david kendall and directed , barely , by there's something about mary co-writer ed decter . 
the entire film is one big excuse to play one lewd scene after another . about half of them are funny , a few are sexy and none are useful in telling the story , which is paper-thin and decidedly unoriginal . 
there's not a spark of new inspiration in it , just more of the same , done with noticeably less energy and imagination . 
 . . . about as exciting to watch as two last-place basketball teams playing one another on the final day of the season . 
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in . 
in this film , aussie david caesar channels the not-quite-dead career of guy ritchie . 
don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
'cq may one day be fondly remembered as roman coppola's brief pretentious period before going on to other films that actually tell a story worth caring about
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . 
an ugly , pointless , stupid movie . 
if this is cinema , i pledge allegiance to cagney and lacey . 
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen . 
whole stretches of the film may be incomprehensible to moviegoers not already clad in basic black . 
empire can't make up its mind whether it wants to be a gangster flick or an art film . it doesn't work as either . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
even if you're an elvis person , you won't find anything to get excited about on this dvd . 
insufferably naive . 
wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . 
kung pow seems like some futile concoction that was developed hastily after oedekerk and his fellow moviemakers got through crashing a college keg party . 
the redeeming feature of chan's films has always been the action , but the stunts in the tuxedo seem tired and , what's worse , routine . 
you leave feeling like you've endured a long workout without your pulse ever racing . 
the script is a dim-witted pairing of teen-speak and animal gibberish . 
these people wouldn't know subtle characterization if it put on a giant furry monster costume and then gave them a lapdance . 
little more than a frothy vanity project . 
its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . 
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
it's all surface psychodramatics . 
flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . 
despite bearing the paramount imprint , it's a bargain-basement european pickup . what's hard to understand is why anybody picked it up . wiser souls would have tactfully pretended not to see it and left it lying there
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
the movie's ultimate point -- that everyone should be themselves -- is trite , but the screenwriter and director michel gondry restate it to the point of ridiculousness . 
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
the film is a confusing melange of tones and styles , one moment a romantic trifle and the next a turgid drama . 
there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . 
releasing a film with the word 'dog' in its title in january lends itself to easy jokes and insults , and snow dogs deserves every single one of them . 
at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . 
 if the predictability of bland comfort food appeals to you , then the film is a pleasant enough dish . 
the story . . . is moldy and obvious . 
when 'science fiction' takes advantage of the fact that its intended audience hasn't yet had much science , it does a disservice to the audience and to the genre . 
all of the elements are in place for a great film noir , but director george hickenlooper's approach to the material is too upbeat . 
snipes relies too much on a scorchingly plotted dramatic scenario for its own good . 
despite the authenticity of the trappings , the film is overblown in its plotting , hackneyed in its dialogue and anachronistic in its style . 
a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
more trifle than triumph . 
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . 
the script ? please . 
has all the scenic appeal of a cesspool . 
a simpler , leaner treatment would have been preferable ; after all , being about nothing is sometimes funnier than being about something . 
observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom . 
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike . . . a cult hero . 
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . 
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels . 
visually sumptuous but intellectually stultifying . 
there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant . 
a dark , dull thriller with a parting shot that misfires . 
dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . 
terrible . 
even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
even in terms of the low-grade cheese standards on which it operates , it never quite makes the grade as tawdry trash . 
'butterfingered' is the word for the big-fisted direction of jez butterworth , who manages to blast even the smallest sensitivities from the romance with his clamorous approach . 
consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
the film tries to touch on spousal abuse but veers off course and becomes just another revenge film . 
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version . 
there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . 
so clichéd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart . 
seems like something american and european gay movies were doing 20 years ago . 
stale , futile scenario . 
oft-described as the antidote to american pie-type sex comedies , it actually has a bundle in common with them , as the film diffuses every opportunity for a breakthrough
writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call 'too clever by half . '
afraid to pitch into farce , yet only half-hearted in its spy mechanics , all the queen's men is finally just one long drag . 
for all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2-hour running time . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
somewhere in the middle , the film compels , as demme experiments he harvests a few movie moment gems , but the field of roughage dominates . 
tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 . 
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context . 
a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . 
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
o ótimo esforço do diretor acaba sendo frustrado pelo roteiro , que , depois de levar um bom tempo para colocar a trama em andamento , perde-se de vez a partir do instante em que os estranhos acontecimentos são explicados . 
 . . . a complete shambles of a movie so sloppy , so uneven , so damn unpleasant that i can't believe any viewer , young or old , would have a good time here . 
oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me . 
just another disjointed , fairly predictable psychological thriller . 
if disney's cinderella proved that 'a dream is a wish your heart makes , ' then cinderella ii proves that a nightmare is a wish a studio's wallet makes . 
the movie ends with outtakes in which most of the characters forget their lines and just utter 'uhhh , ' which is better than most of the writing in the movie . 
 . . . grows decidedly flimsier with its many out-sized , out of character and logically porous action set pieces . 
christians sensitive to a reductionist view of their lord as a luv-spreading dr . feelgood or omnipotent slacker will feel vastly more affronted than secularists , who might even praise god for delivering such an instant camp classic . 
broomfield's style of journalism is hardly journalism at all , and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient . 
the director and her capable cast appear to be caught in a heady whirl of new age-inspired good intentions , but the spell they cast isn't the least bit mesmerizing . 
 " men in black ii , " has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? 
formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes " never again " worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice
a waste of fearless purity in the acting craft . 
oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring . 
the streets , shot by cinematographer michael ballhaus , may be as authentic as they are mean , but it is nearly impossible to care about what happens on them . 
seagal ran out of movies years ago , and this is just the proof . 
epps has neither the charisma nor the natural affability that has made tucker a star . 
 . . . an airless , prepackaged julia roberts wannabe that stinks so badly of hard-sell image-mongering you'll wonder if lopez's publicist should share screenwriting credit . 
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage . 
 . . . watching this film nearly provoked me to take my own life . and if the hours wins 'best picture' i just might . 
the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! 
given that both movies expect us to root for convicted violent felons over those assigned to protect us from same , we need every bit of sympathy the cons can muster ; this time , there isn't much . 
with its paint fights , motorized scooter chases and dewy-eyed sentiment , it's a pretty listless collection of kid-movie clichés . 
an average b-movie with no aspirations to be anything more . 
yet another arnold vehicle that fails to make adequate use of his particular talents . 
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier . 
a woefully dull , redundant concept that bears more than a whiff of exploitation , despite iwai's vaunted empathy . 
the screenplay comes across , rather unintentionally , as hip-hop scooby-doo . 
a wishy-washy melodramatic movie that shows us plenty of sturm und drung , but explains its characters' decisions only unsatisfactorily . 
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . 
a generic family comedy unlikely to be appreciated by anyone outside the under-10 set . 
why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ? 
a chilly , remote , emotionally distant piece . . . so dull that its tagline should be : 'in space , no one can hear you snore . '
[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . 
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage . 
 . . . a mostly boring affair with a confusing sudden finale that's likely to irk viewers . 
lazy filmmaking , with the director taking a hands-off approach when he should have shaped the story to show us why it's compelling . 
the one not-so-small problem with expecting is that the entire exercise has no real point . 
a film with a great premise but only a great premise . 
any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
the comedy is nonexistent . 
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) . 
while it's nice to watch a movie that hasn't been focus-grouped into tedium , yu's cinematic alchemy produces nearly as much lead as gold . 
some body is a shaky , uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves . 
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
some of it is clever , but it is never melodic/
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
like a documentary version of fight club , shorn of social insight , intellectual pretension and cinematic interest . 
a frantic search for laughs , with a hit-to-miss ratio that doesn't exactly favour the audience . 
has the disjointed feel of a bunch of strung-together tv episodes . 
really dumb but occasionally really funny . 
there's nothing to gain from watching they . it isn't scary . it hates its characters . it finds no way to entertain or inspire its viewers . 
spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . 
appropriately cynical social commentary aside , #9 never quite ignites . 
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism . 
 . . . familiar and predictable , and 4/5ths of it might as well have come from a xerox machine rather than ( writer-director ) franc . reyes' word processor . 
a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor . 
a loud , brash and mainly unfunny high school comedy . 
if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that's so bad it starts to become good . but it wasn't . 
not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of 'eh . '
this is not one of the movies you'd want to watch if you only had a week to live . 
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
[n]o matter how much good will the actors generate , showtime eventually folds under its own thinness . 
 . . . if you , like me , think an action film disguised as a war tribute is disgusting to begin with , then you're in for a painful ride . 
john carlen's script is full of unhappy , two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling . 
it's hard to believe these jokers are supposed to have pulled off four similar kidnappings before . 
it's as if allen , at 66 , has stopped challenging himself . 
safe conduct , however ambitious and well-intentioned , fails to hit the entertainment bull's-eye . 
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
a light , engaging comedy that fumbles away almost all of its accumulated enjoyment with a crucial third act miscalculation . 
showtime is closer to slowtime . 
[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes . 
overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
demme's loose approach kills the suspense . 
winds up feeling like lots of other quirky movies that try to score hipness points with young adults . 
collapses under its own meager weight . 
loud , chaotic and largely unfunny . 
a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . 
a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor . 
i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind . 
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through . 
fancy a real downer ? [leigh] lays it on so thick this time that it feels like a suicide race . 
a puzzle whose pieces do not fit . some are fascinating and others are not , and in the end , it is almost a good movie . 
from its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , bartleby squanders as much as it gives out . 
not even the hanson brothers can save it
whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . 
well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special . 
given too much time to consider the looseness of the piece , the picture begins to resemble the shapeless , grasping actors' workshop that it is . 
a lightweight , uneven action comedy that freely mingles french , japanese and hollywood cultures . 
as an actor , the rock is aptly named . 
in the end , we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love , chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest . 
more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
the images are usually abbreviated in favor of mushy obviousness and telegraphed pathos , particularly where whitaker's misfit artist is concerned . 
a sleep-inducingly slow-paced crime drama with clumsy dialogue , heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment , and an overly-familiar set of plot devices . 
please , someone , stop eric schaeffer before he makes another film . 
the cumulative effect of the movie is repulsive and depressing . 
it never rises to its clever what-if concept . 
in the end , there isn't much to it . 
 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
it reduces the complexities to bromides and slogans and it gets so preachy-keen and so tub-thumpingly loud it makes you feel like a chump just for sitting through it . 
an unsophisticated sci-fi drama that takes itself all too seriously . 
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
wins my vote for 'the 2002 enemy of cinema' award . 
nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it , from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its last-minute , haphazard theatrical release . 
a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity . 
a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . 
barry sonnenfeld owes frank the pug big time
i could have used my two hours better watching being john malkovich again . 
the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today's hollywood . 
more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine
tedious norwegian offering which somehow snagged an oscar nomination . 
the film takes the materials of human tragedy and dresses them in lovely costumes , southern california locations and star power . 
a dull , inconsistent , dishonest female bonding picture . 
not exactly the bees knees
it's young guns meets goodfellas in this easily skippable hayseeds-vs . -greaseballs mob action-comedy . 
an artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike .

why , you may ask , why should you buy the movie milk when the tv cow is free ? there's no good answer to that one .

beers , who , when she's given the right lines , can charm the paint off the wall . . . [but] the script goes wrong at several key junctures . 
accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license . 
writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability . 
 . . . the film falls back on the same old formula of teen sex , outrageous pranks and scenes designed to push the envelope of bad taste for laughs . 
a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
muddled , trashy and incompetent
you're better off staying home and watching the x-files . 
a family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise . 
too much of nemesis has a tired , talky feel . 
the movie is gorgeously made , but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious . 
a complete waste of time . 
[toback's] fondness for fancy split-screen , stuttering editing and pompous references to wittgenstein and kirkegaard . . . blends uneasily with the titillating material . 
silly , loud and goofy . 
a generic international version of a typical american horror film . 
buries an interesting storyline about morality and the choices we make underneath such a mountain of clichés and borrowed images that it might more accurately be titled mr . chips off the old block . 
it's sincere to a fault , but , unfortunately , not very compelling or much fun .

there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
nothing more than a run-of-the-mill action flick .

philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess .

a surprisingly flat retread , hobbled by half-baked setups and sluggish pacing . 
although disney follows its standard formula in this animated adventure , it feels more forced than usual . 
stirs potentially enticing ingredients into an uneasy blend of ghost and close encounters of the third kind . 
holden caulfield did it better .

a cleverly crafted but ultimately hollow mockumentary . 
the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine .

it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
this is a movie that starts out like heathers , then becomes bring it on , then becomes unwatchable . 
it has the right approach and the right opening premise , but it lacks the zest and it goes for a plot twist instead of trusting the material . 
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
it's supposed to be a romantic comedy - it suffers from too much norma rae and not enough pretty woman . 
animated drivel meant to enhance the self-image of drooling idiots . 
an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
crudup's screen presence is the one thing that holds interest in the midst of a mushy , existential exploration of why men leave their families . 
not only does the thoroughly formulaic film represent totally exemplify middle-of-the-road mainstream , it also represents glossy hollywood at its laziest . 
the movie is so contrived , nonsensical and formulaic that , come to think of it , the day-old shelf would be a more appropriate location to store it . 
a thoroughly awful movie--dumb , narratively chaotic , visually sloppy . . . a weird amalgam of 'the thing' and a geriatric 'scream . '
a loud , low-budget and tired formula film that arrives cloaked in the euphemism 'urban drama . '
an unencouraging threefold expansion on the former mtv series , accompanying the stunt-hungry dimwits in a random series of collected gags , pranks , pratfalls , dares , injuries , etc . 
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? 
an uplifting , largely bogus story . 
skip this turd and pick your nose instead because you're sure to get more out of the latter experience . 
you get the impression that writer and director burr steers knows the territory . . . but his sense of humor has yet to lose the smug self-satisfaction usually associated with the better private schools . 
made with no discernible craft and monstrously sanctimonious in dealing with childhood loss . 
by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . 
two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity . 
worthless , from its pseudo-rock-video opening to the idiocy of its last frames . 
set in a 1986 harlem that doesn't look much like anywhere in new york . 
 . . . pays tribute to heroes the way julia roberts hands out awards--with phony humility barely camouflaging grotesque narcissism . 
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor . 
more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
 . . . plays like a badly edited , 91-minute trailer ( and ) the director can't seem to get a coherent rhythm going . in fact , it doesn't even seem like she tried . 
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset . 
to the filmmakers , ivan is a prince of a fellow , but he comes across as shallow and glib though not mean-spirited , and there's no indication that he's been responsible for putting together any movies of particular value or merit . 
supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy . alas , getting there is not even half the interest . 
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . 
journalistically dubious , inept and often lethally dull . 
though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work . 
an appalling 'ace ventura' rip-off that somehow manages to bring together kevin pollak , former wrestler chyna and dolly parton . if any of them list this 'credit' on their resumes in the future , that'll be much funnier than anything in the film . . . 
if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . 
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . 
who , exactly , is fighting whom here ? ah , yes , that would be me : fighting off the urge to doze . 
melanie eventually slugs the yankee . too bad the former murphy brown doesn't pop reese back . 
…it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous , " wait a second , did i miss something ? " ending . 
just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
it's the element of condescension , as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful . 
borrows from other movies like it in the most ordinary and obvious fashion . 
with rare birds , as with the shipping news before it , an attempt is made to transplant a hollywood star into newfoundland's wild soil -- and the rock once again resists the intrusion . 
mindless and boring martial arts and gunplay with too little excitement and zero compelling storyline . 
the lower your expectations , the more you'll enjoy it . 
yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through . 
punitively affirmational parable . 
a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . 
sunshine state lacks the kind of dynamic that limbo offers , and in some ways is a rather indulgent piece . 
i'm giving it thumbs down due to the endlessly repetitive scenes of embarrassment . there's got to be a more graceful way of portraying the devastation of this disease . 
 . . . a cheap , ludicrous attempt at serious horror . 
barely goes beyond comic book status . 
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
it's not original enough . 
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long . 
aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . 
the best way to hope for any chance of enjoying this film is by lowering your expectations . then lower them a bit more . 
so routine , familiar and predictable , it raises the possibility that it wrote itself as a newly automated final draft computer program . 
halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . 
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness . 
the problem is the needlessly poor quality of its archival prints and film footage . the images lack contrast , are murky and are frequently too dark to be decipherable . 
with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side . 
this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . 
anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
overall the film feels like a low-budget tv pilot that could not find a buyer to play it on the tube . 
a collage of clichés and a dim echo of allusions to other films . 
one of the worst films of 2002 . 
it would be churlish to begrudge anyone for receiving whatever consolation that can be found in dragonfly , yet it is impossible to find the film anything but appalling , shamelessly manipulative and contrived , and totally lacking in conviction . 
the thought of watching this film with an audience full of teenagers fixating on its body humour and reinforcement of stereotypes ( of which they'll get plenty ) fills me with revulsion . 
an awful lot like one of [spears'] music videos in content -- except that it goes on for at least 90 more minutes and , worse , that you have to pay if you want to see it . 
a handsome but unfulfilling suspense drama more suited to a quiet evening on pbs than a night out at an amc . 
like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded . 
myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . 
this one is a few bits funnier than malle's dud , if only because the cast is so engagingly messing around like slob city reductions of damon runyon crooks . 
the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
these characters become wearisome . 
 . . . this movie has a glossy coat of action movie excess while remaining heartless at its core . 
the movie's vision of a white american zealously spreading a puritanical brand of christianity to south seas islanders is one only a true believer could relish . 
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
aspires to the cracked lunacy of the adventures of buckaroo banzai , but thanks to an astonishingly witless script ends up more like the adventures of ford fairlane . 
nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . 
self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . 
an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg's the prince of egypt from 1998 . 
too much of the humor falls flat . 
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold . 
the problem , amazingly enough , is the screenplay . 
a well made indieflick in need of some trims and a more chemistry between its stars . 
brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
while there's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the elizabethans ( as well as rank frustration from those in the know about rubbo's dumbed-down tactics ) , much ado about something is an amicable endeavor . 
this is so bad . 
occasionally interesting but essentially unpersuasive , a footnote to a still evolving story . 
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . 
director shekhar kapur and screenwriters michael schiffer and hossein amini have tried hard to modernize and reconceptualize things , but the barriers finally prove to be too great . 
the film's thoroughly recycled plot and tiresome jokes . . . drag the movie down . 
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
the exploitative , clumsily staged violence overshadows everything , including most of the actors . 
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . 
a movie that's held captive by mediocrity . not bad , but not all that good . bacon keeps things interesting , but don't go out of your way to pay full price . 
hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors , but it doesn't . 
plays like a bad blend of an overripe episode of tv's dawson's creek and a recycled and dumbed-down version of love story . 
clayburgh and tambor are charming performers ; neither of them deserves eric schaeffer . 
great story , bad idea for a movie . 
each scene wreaks of routine ; the film never manages to generate a single threat of suspense . 
it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . 
 " juwanna mann ? " no thanks . wewannour money back , actually . 
the film's essentially over by the meet-cute . 
adam sandler's 8 crazy nights is 75 wasted minutes of sandler as the voice-over hero in columbia pictures' perverse idea of an animated holiday movie . 
rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . 
has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
you really have to wonder how on earth anyone , anywhere could have thought they'd make audiences guffaw with a script as utterly diabolical as this . 
lurid and less than lucid work . 
real-life strongman ahola lacks the charisma and ability to carry the film on his admittedly broad shoulders . 
an instant candidate for worst movie of the year . 
i still can't relate to stuart : he's a mouse , for cryin' out loud , and all he does is milk it with despondent eyes and whine that nobody treats him human enough . 
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . 
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
however sincere it may be , the rising place never quite justifies its own existence . 
those who are only mildly curious , i fear , will be put to sleep or bewildered by the artsy and often pointless visuals . 
the central story lacks punch . 
even as lame horror flicks go , this is lame . 
a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . 
this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . 
detox is ultimately a pointless endeavor . 
when one hears harry shearer is going to make his debut as a film director , one would hope for the best
in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . 
they takes a long time to get to its gasp-inducing ending . 
unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . 
the attempt is courageous , even if the result is wildly uneven . 
never again , while nothing special , is pleasant , diverting and modest -- definitely a step in the right direction . 
the period -- swinging london in the time of the mods and the rockers -- gets the once-over once again in gangster no . 1 , but falls apart long before the end . 
it's easy to love robin tunney -- she's pretty and she can act -- but it gets harder and harder to understand her choices . 
the documentary is much too conventional -- lots of boring talking heads , etc . -- to do the subject matter justice . 
the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run . 
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . 
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . 
on a cutting room floor somewhere lies . . . footage that might have made no such thing a trenchant , ironic cultural satire instead of a frustrating misfire . 
oozes condescension from every pore . 
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending . 
rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue . 
i don't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but don't treat me like a fool . 
 . . . feels as if ( there's ) a choke leash around your neck so director nick cassavetes can give it a good , hard yank whenever he wants you to feel something . 
'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental . 
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
the smash 'em-up , crash 'em-up , shoot 'em-up ending comes out of nowhere substituting mayhem for suspense . 
true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . 
the film might have been more satisfying if it had , in fact , been fleshed out a little more instead of going for easy smiles . 
forget the psychology 101 study of romantic obsession and just watch the procession of costumes in castles and this won't seem like such a bore . 
the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . 
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
it's a boring movie about a boring man , made watchable by a bravura performance from a consummate actor incapable of being boring . 
since dahmer resorts to standard slasher flick thrills when it should be most in the mind of the killer , it misses a major opportunity to be truly revelatory about his psyche . 
has an uppity musical beat that you can dance to , but its energy can't compare to the wit , humor and snappy dialogue of the original . if i want music , i'll buy the soundtrack . if i want a real movie , i'll buy the criterion dvd . 
the film's lack of personality permeates all its aspects — from the tv movie-esque , affected child acting to the dullest irish pub scenes ever filmed . 
freundlich's made [crudup] a suburban architect , and a cipher . 
the story itself is uninteresting , and the songs are painfully undistinguished : they might be giants' so to be one of us may be the most tuneless tune ever composed . 
it's such a mechanical endeavor [that] it never bothers to question why somebody might devote time to see it . 
 . . . a low rate annie featuring some kid who can't act , only echoes of jordan , and weirdo actor crispin glover screwing things up old school . 
while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . 
it wouldn't matter so much that this arrogant richard pryor wannabe's routine is offensive , puerile and unimaginatively foul-mouthed if it was at least funny . 
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year . 
this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . 
this is rote drivel aimed at mom and dad's wallet . 
here the love scenes all end in someone screaming . maybe there's a metaphor here , but figuring it out wouldn't make trouble every day any better . 
 . . little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic . 
too close to phantom menace for comfort . 
looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito's way . 
the film wasn't preachy , but it was feminism by the book . 
an afterschool special without the courage of its convictions . 
it's so full of wrong choices that all you can do is shake your head in disbelief -- and worry about what classic oliver parker intends to mangle next time . 
a listless and desultory affair . 
if kaufman kept cameron diaz a prisoner in a cage with her ape , in his latest , he'd have them mate . 
i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief . 
the art direction is often exquisite , and the anthropomorphic animal characters are beautifully realized through clever makeup design , leaving one to hope that the eventual dvd release will offer subtitles and the original italian-language soundtrack . 
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
a negligible british comedy . 
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval . 
always destined to be measured against anthony asquith's acclaimed 1952 screen adaptation . 
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
you might be shocked to discover that seinfeld's real life is boring . 
without the dark spookiness of crystal lake camp , the horror concept completely loses its creepy menace . 
cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying . 
a humorless journey into a philosophical void . 
cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . 
though avary has done his best to make something out of ellis' nothing novel , in the end , his rules is barely worth following . 
hollywood's answer to an air ball . 
between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap . 
burns never really harnesses to full effect the energetic cast . 
 . . . hopefully it'll be at the dollar theatres by the time christmas rolls around . wait to see it then . 
pc stability notwithstanding , the film suffers from a simplistic narrative and a pat , fairy-tale conclusion . 
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
so unremittingly awful that labeling it a dog probably constitutes cruelty to canines . 
one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman's brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002's sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off
showtime's starry cast could be both an asset and a detriment . those who trek to the 'plex predisposed to like it probably will enjoy themselves . but ticket-buyers with great expectations will wind up as glum as mr . de niro . 
this tale has been told and retold ; the races and rackets change , but the song remains the same . 
it appears that something has been lost in the translation to the screen . 
i hate this movie
it's like an all-star salute to disney's cheesy commercialism . 
message movie or an action-packed submarine spectacular ? alas , it's neither . 
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . 
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss . 
'dragonfly' is a movie about a bus wreck that turns into a film wreck . 
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . 
fairly run-of-the-mill . 
because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags . 
a respectable but uninspired thriller that's intelligent and considered in its details , but ultimately weak in its impact . 
producer john penotti surveyed high school students . . . and came back with the astonishing revelation that " they wanted to see something that didn't talk down to them . " ignoring that , he made swimfan anyway
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . 
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest . 
the movie , while beautiful , feels labored , with a hint of the writing exercise about it . 
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill
leaves you with a knot in your stomach , its power is undercut by its own head-banging obviousness . 
reign of fire never comes close to recovering from its demented premise , but it does sustain an enjoyable level of ridiculousness . 
simply put , there should have been a more compelling excuse to pair susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
a mawkish self-parody that plays like some weird masterpiece theater sketch with neither a point of view nor a compelling reason for being . 
sewer rats could watch this movie and be so skeeved out that they'd need a shower . 
even if it is generally amusing from time to time , i spy has all the same problems the majority of action comedies have . 
alternately frustrating and rewarding . 
an extremely unpleasant film . 
much like its easily dismissive take on the upscale lifestyle , there isn't much there here . 
the holiday message of the 37-minute santa vs . the snowman leaves a lot to be desired . 
american chai encourages rueful laughter at stereotypes only an indian-american would recognize . and the lesson , in the end , is nothing new . 
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
the elements were all there but lack of a pyschological center knocks it flat . 
the movie's major and most devastating flaw is its reliance on formula , though , and it's quite enough to lessen the overall impact the movie could have had . 
everything -- even life on an aircraft carrier -- is sentimentalized . 
christina ricci comedy about sympathy , hypocrisy and love is a misfire . 
in my own very humble opinion , in praise of love lacks even the most fragmented charms i have found in almost all of his previous works . 
off the hook is overlong and not well-acted , but credit writer-producer-director adam watstein with finishing it at all . 
narratively , trouble every day is a plodding mess . 
a dull , simple-minded and stereotypical tale of drugs , death and mind-numbing indifference on the inner-city streets . 
a movie that tries to fuse the two 'woods' but winds up a bolly-holly masala mess . 
should have been someone else-
labute was more fun when his characters were torturing each other psychologically and talking about their genitals in public . 
the truth about charlie is that it's a brazenly misguided project . 
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . 
there may have been a good film in " trouble every day , " but it is not what is on the screen . 
grant isn't cary and bullock isn't katherine . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
resurrection has the dubious distinction of being a really bad imitation of the really bad blair witch project . 
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet . 
call me a cold-hearted curmudgeon for not being able to enjoy a mindless action movie , but i believe a movie can be mindless without being the peak of all things insipid . 
[swimfan] falls victim to sloppy plotting , an insultingly unbelievable final act and a villainess who is too crazy to be interesting . 
one can't shake the feeling that crossroads is nothing more than an hour-and-a-half-long commercial for britney's latest album . 
everything about girls can't swim , even its passages of sensitive observation , feels secondhand , familiar -- and not in a good way . 
the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption . 
calculated swill . 
imagine kevin smith , the blasphemous bad boy of suburban jersey , if he were stripped of most of his budget and all of his sense of humor . the result might look like vulgar . 
the type of dumbed-down exercise in stereotypes that gives the [teen comedy] genre a bad name . 
kurys seems intimidated by both her subject matter and the period trappings of this debut venture into the heritage business . 
humor in i spy is so anemic . 
just an average comedic dateflick but not a waste of time . 
 . . . the last time i saw a theater full of people constantly checking their watches was during my sats . 
a cinematic sleeping pill of impressive potency . 
bluto blutarsky , we miss you . 
 . . . unbearably lame . 
despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
i'll bet the video game is a lot more fun than the film . 
if you think it's a riot to see rob schneider in a young woman's clothes , then you'll enjoy the hot chick . 
a good-natured ensemble comedy that tries hard to make the most of a bumper cast , but never quite gets off the ground . 
trivial where it should be profound , and hyper-cliched where it should be sincere . 
it's a movie forged in the fires of chick flick hell . 
a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring . 
scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
hollywood ending is the most disappointing woody allen movie ever . he has a great cast and a great idea . but the execution is a flop with the exception of about six gags that really work . 
barney's ideas about creation and identity don't really seem all that profound , at least by way of what can be gleaned from this three-hour endurance test built around an hour's worth of actual material . 
essentially a collection of bits -- and they're all naughty . 
dull and mechanical , kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit
this is a fudged opportunity of gigantic proportions -- a lunar mission with no signs of life . 
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . 
too restrained to be a freak show , too mercenary and obvious to be cerebral , too dull and pretentious to be engaging . . . the isle defies an easy categorization . 
totally overwrought , deeply biased , and wholly designed to make you feel guilty about ignoring what the filmmakers clearly believe are the greatest musicians of all time . 
loosely speaking , we're in all of me territory again , and , strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin . 
don michael paul uses quick-cuts , ( very ) large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double ( for seagal ) . 
you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
a non-britney person might survive a screening with little harm done , except maybe for the last 15 minutes , which are as maudlin as any after-school special you can imagine . 
a tired , unimaginative and derivative variation of that already-shallow genre . 
sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle . 
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . 
it has more in common with a fireworks display than a movie , which normally is expected to have characters and a storyline . 
the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
for all the writhing and wailing , tears , rage and opium overdoses , there's no sense of actual passion being washed away in love's dissolution . 
the entire point of a shaggy dog story , of course , is that it goes nowhere , and this is classic nowheresville in every sense .

the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor . 
the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing . 
feels like pieces a bunch of other , better movies slapped together . 
barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull .

a sudsy cautionary tale . 
a fifty car pileup of cliches . 
tale will be all too familiar for anyone who's seen george roy hill's 1973 film , " the sting . "

a 75-minute sample of puerile rubbish that is listless , witless , and devoid of anything resembling humor . 
it treats women like idiots . 
while it is interesting to witness the conflict from the palestinian side , longley's film lacks balance . . . and fails to put the struggle into meaningful historical context .

to the vast majority of more casual filmgoers , it will probably be a talky bore . 
the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . 
most of the film feels conceived and shot on the fly -- like between lunch breaks for shearer's radio show and his simpson voice-overs . 
while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . 
a few nonbelievers may rethink their attitudes when they see the joy the characters take in this creed , but skeptics aren't likely to enter the theater . 
ultimately . . . the movie is too heady for children , and too preachy for adults .

what's next ? rob schneider , dana carvey and sarah michelle gellar in the philadelphia story ? david spade as citizen kane ? 
obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time ( including mine ) on something very inconsequential . 
one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . 
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . 
just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . 
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . 
wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
it will probably prove interesting to ram dass fans , but to others it may feel like a parody of the mellow , peace-and-love side of the '60s counterculture . 
the french director has turned out nearly 21/2 hours of unfocused , excruciatingly tedious cinema that , half an hour in , starts making water torture seem appealing . 
while it's all quite tasteful to look at , the attention process tends to do a little fleeing of its own . 
it doesn't matter that the film is less than 90 minutes . it still feels like a prison stretch . 
a sequel that's much too big for its britches . 
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . 
you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
the film is old-fashioned , occasionally charming and as subtle as boldface . 
while easier to sit through than most of jaglom's self-conscious and gratingly irritating films , it's still tainted by cliches , painful improbability and murky points . 
the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . 
brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
 . . . although this idea is " new " the results are tired . 
robin williams departs from his fun friendly demeanor in exchange for a darker unnerving role . 
has its charming quirks and its dull spots . 
one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition . 
solaris is rigid and evasive in ways that soderbergh's best films , " erin brockovich , " " out of sight " and " ocean's eleven , " never were . 
a movie to forget
bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . 
storytelling feels slight . 
not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since the bad news bears has been ? -- but certainly hard to hate . 
just isn't as weird as it ought to be . 
louiso lets the movie dawdle in classic disaffected-indie-film mode , and brother hoffman's script stumbles over a late-inning twist that just doesn't make sense . 
no one involved , save dash , shows the slightest aptitude for acting , and the script , credited to director abdul malik abbott and ernest 'tron' anderson , seems entirely improvised . 
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
everyone's to blame here . 
the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments . 
sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
simone is not a bad film . it just doesn't have anything really interesting to say . 
the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish . 
 . . . will always be remembered for the 9-11 terrorist attacks . after seeing the film , i can tell you that there's no other reason why anyone should bother remembering it . 
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying . 
so-so entertainment . 
its salient points are simultaneously buried , drowned and smothered in the excesses of writer-director roger avary . 
so mind-numbingly awful that you hope britney won't do it one more time , as far as movies are concerned . 
'this movie sucks . '
i can't remember the last time i saw worse stunt editing or cheaper action movie production values than in extreme ops . 
pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r . abrams , in their feature debut . 
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about
to call this film a lump of coal would only be to flatter it . 
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder . 
the pace of the film is very slow ( for obvious reasons ) and that too becomes off-putting . 
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched . 
a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . 
about as cutting-edge as pet rock : the movie . 
there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them . 
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
there is one surefire way to get a nomination for a best-foreign-film oscar : make a movie about whimsical folk who learn a nonchallenging , life-affirming lesson while walking around a foreign city with stunning architecture . 
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality
an infuriating film . just when you think you are making sense of it , something happens that tells you there is no sense . 
a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving . 
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . 
the best that can be said about the work here of scottish director ritchie . . . is that he obviously doesn't have his heart in it . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . 
as gamely as the movie tries to make sense of its title character , there remains a huge gap between the film's creepy , clean-cut dahmer ( jeremy renner ) and fiendish acts that no amount of earnest textbook psychologizing can bridge . 
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
the dose is strong and funny , for the first 15 minutes anyway ; after that , the potency wanes dramatically . 
sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
the action quickly sinks into by-the-numbers territory . 
it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . 
despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another . 
call me a cynic , but there's something awfully deadly about any movie with a life-affirming message . 
the movie doesn't think much of its characters , its protagonist , or of us . 
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move . 
passably entertaining but also mechanical and joyless . 
 . . . a plotline that's as lumpy as two-day old porridge . . . the filmmakers' paws , sad to say , were all over this " un-bear-able " project ! 
this mild-mannered farce , directed by one of its writers , john c . walsh , is corny in a way that bespeaks an expiration date passed a long time ago . 
it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel . 
new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video . 
this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . 
it's not a bad plot ; but , unfortunately , the movie is nowhere near as refined as all the classic dramas it borrows from . 
despite a blue-chip cast and a provocative title , writer-director peter mattei's first feature microwaves dull leftover romantic motifs basted in faux-contemporary gravy . 
considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well . 
[a] poorly executed comedy . 
there are few things more frustrating to a film buff than seeing an otherwise good movie marred beyond redemption by a disastrous ending . 
somewhere inside the mess that is world traveler , there is a mediocre movie trying to get out . 
i didn't find much fascination in the swinging . what they're doing is a matter of plumbing arrangements and mind games , of no erotic or sensuous charge . but that they are doing it is thought-provoking . 
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . 
a perfect example of rancid , well-intentioned , but shamelessly manipulative movie making . 
the only way this supernatural snore-fest could give anyone a case of the frights is if they were put to sleep by the movie and had a nightmare . 
it's hampered by a lifetime-channel kind of plot and a lead actress who is out of her depth . 
the best thing that can be said of the picture is that it does have a few cute moments . 
another boorish movie from the i-heard-a-joke- at-a-frat-party school of screenwriting . 
it takes a strange kind of laziness to waste the talents of robert forster , anne meara , eugene levy , and reginald veljohnson all in the same movie . 
will probably be one of those movies barely registering a blip on the radar screen of 2002 . 
 . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
piccoli's performance is amazing , yes , but the symbols of loss and denial and life-at-arm's-length in the film seem irritatingly transparent . 
overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
mr . wedge and mr . saldanha handle the mix of verbal jokes and slapstick well . their film falters , however , in its adherence to the disney philosophy of required poignancy , a salute that i'd hoped the movie would avoid . 
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt . 
lacking substance and soul , crossroads comes up shorter than britney's cutoffs . 
predictably melodramatic . 
limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly . 
viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
largely a for-fans artifact . 
even if it ultimately disappoints , the picture does have about a matinee admission's worth of funny to keep it afloat . 
so few movies explore religion that it's disappointing to see one reduce it to an idea that fits in a sampler . 
it's drained of life in an attempt to be sober and educational , and yet it's so devoid of realism that its lack of whistles and bells just makes it obnoxious and stiff . 
'god help us , but capra and cooper are rolling over in their graves . '
a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . 
harrison's flowers puts its heart in the right place , but its brains are in no particular place at all . 
often silly – and gross – but it's rarely as moronic as some campus gross-out films . 
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
if you're a wwf fan , or you related to the people who watched the robots getting butchered in a . i . , you'll probably like rollerball . 
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke . 
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence . 
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . 
charlize chases kevin with a gun . courtney chases stuart with a cell phone . the sound of gunfire and cell phones ringing . 
about as satisfying and predictable as the fare at your local drive through . 
could as easily have been called 'under siege 3 : in alcatraz' . . . a cinematic corpse that never springs to life . 
some movies were made for the big screen , some for the small screen , and some , like ballistic : ecks vs . sever , were made for the palm screen . 
this heist flick about young brooklyn hoods is off the shelf after two years to capitalize on the popularity of vin diesel , seth green and barry pepper . it should have stayed there . 
this dreadfully earnest inversion of the concubine love triangle eschews the previous film's historical panorama and roiling pathos for bug-eyed mugging and gay-niche condescension . 
the audience when i saw this one was chuckling at all the wrong times , and that's a bad sign when they're supposed to be having a collective heart attack .

nothing more than a mediocre trifle . 
what madonna does here can't properly be called acting -- more accurately , it's moving and it's talking and it's occasionally gesturing , sometimes all at once .

wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .

how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
hey , at least the title of this film lets you know exactly where it's heading . 
 . . . while certainly clever in spots , this too-long , spoofy update of shakespeare's macbeth doesn't sustain a high enough level of invention .

a bad movie that happened to good actors .

as plain and pedestrian as catsup--
unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . 
one big blustery movie where nothing really happens . when it comes out on video , then it's the perfect cure for insomnia .

an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . 
pleasant but not more than recycled jock piffle . 
needless to say , the dramatics that follow are utter hooey . 
the story is predictable , the jokes are typical sandler fare , and the romance with ryder is puzzling . 
it may play well as a double feature with mainstream foreign mush like my big fat greek wedding
although no pastry is violated , this nasty comedy pokes fun at the same easy targets as other rowdy raunch-fests -- farts , boobs , unmentionables -- without much success . 
it's mired in a shabby script that piles layer upon layer of action man cliché atop wooden dialogue and a shifting tone that falls far short of the peculiarly moral amorality of [woo's] best work . 
forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
goldbacher draws on an elegant visual sense and a talent for easy , seductive pacing . . . but she and writing partner laurence coriat don't manage an equally assured narrative coinage . 
a jumbled fantasy comedy that did not figure out a coherent game plan at scripting , shooting or post-production stages . 
not only does leblanc make one spectacularly ugly-looking broad , but he appears miserable throughout as he swaggers through his scenes . 
the film's final hour , where nearly all the previous unseen material resides , is unconvincing soap opera that tornatore was right to cut . 
smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . 
i don't think this movie loves women at all . 
astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent , incoherent or just plain crap . indeed , none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is deuces wild . 
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . 
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . 
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
propelled not by characters but by caricatures . 
by the end , you just don't care whether that cold-hearted snake petrovich ( that would be reno ) gets his comeuppance . just bring on the battle bots , please ! 
while there's something intrinsically funny about sir anthony hopkins saying 'get in the car , bitch , ' this jerry bruckheimer production has little else to offer
my reaction in a word : disappointment . his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . 
there is nothing funny in this every-joke-has- been-told-a- thousand-times- before movie . 
the actors are forced to grapple with hazy motivations that never come into focus . 
the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
it comes off as so silly that you wouldn't be surprised if ba , murdock and rest of the a-team were seen giving chase in a black and red van . 
this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing . 
feels like six different movies fighting each other for attention . 
this is mild-mannered , been-there material given a pedestrian spin by a director who needed a touch of the flamboyant , the outrageous . 
a decidedly mixed bag . 
in the book-on-tape market , the film of " the kid stays in the picture " would be an abridged edition
its inescapable absurdities are tantamount to insulting the intelligence of anyone who hasn't been living under a rock ( since sept . 11 ) . 
the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
big fat liar is just futile silliness looking to tap into the kiddie sensibilities . 
a tv style murder mystery with a few big screen moments ( including one that seems to be made for a different film altogether ) . 
because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , 'swimfan' left me with a very bad feeling . 
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious . 
an entertainment so in love with its overinflated mythology that it no longer recognizes the needs of moviegoers for real characters and compelling plots . 
the film virtually chokes on its own self-consciousness .
